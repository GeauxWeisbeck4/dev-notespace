# Sprint 27 (07.28.25 - 08.10.25)

Lot's going on here.

## Friday - August 8th, 2025 
*Geaux Flow Work Planning, Wegman's Cafe @6:45 PM*

- About ready to get rolling on the real work today. Got to do a bit of learning earlier, but had some other sutff going on today. Spent time setting up this Foam workspace for VS Code, which serves a couple purposes that I will discuss in another context [^1], but right now I've got a lot to focus on.
